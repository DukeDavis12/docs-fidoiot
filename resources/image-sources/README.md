# Guide

1. Each PowerPoint file in this folder contains the figures for its respective document section
2. Page 2 provides the file name required for each of the subsequent pages
3. Pages 3 through N of the document contains the figures - one figure per page.
4. To export the images, simply save as .JPG. PowerPoint will create a folder with the same name as the PowerPoint document, and place one image for each page into that folder.
5. Rename images 3 through N using page 2 to determine the corresponding name
6. You can delete image 1 and 2
7. Copy images 3 through N to the corresponding document section's "img" folder

# Comments
This process could be simplified if all the figure references were simplified to use the name that PowerPoint gives them.  However I found it easier to keep track of the Figures when their name reflected their content.  A possible compromise would be to simplify the names.
